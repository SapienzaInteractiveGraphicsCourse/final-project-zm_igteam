final-project-zm_igteam 
created by Damiano Zappia & Gianluca Maselli for the IG course at Sapienza University of Rome
A.Y. 2019/2020 - prof. Marco Schaerf

The project developed consists in a low poly city, with several buildings, a little airport, a Ferris wheel, and many more buildings and objects. 
Inside the city you can find several animated things, like cars, rotating Ferris wheel, and an eagle.
The eagle is the principal subject of the application. It starts from the tip of the highest skyscraper of the town and flies around all the city making a complex path around. The user is allowed to set the view to the third person watching the stunning movement of the bird around the buildings, or setting it to first person being totally involved in the fly like if he was himself the eagle. 

#### Commands for the user interaction are :

**space bar**: By pressing this button on the keyboard the eagle starts its own animation, flying through the buildings. When the animation is terminated, the user can restart it by pressing the same button again. 
    
**W**: By pressing this button the third person view on the eagle is activated. This view can be exchanged anytime with the first person view, with the following key command. Also, when the user is in first person view, by pressing \texttt{w} again, he can change the camera to return controllable by the mouse.
    
**S**: By pressing this button the first person view is activated. Anytime, the user is allowed to switch the first person view with the third person view during the all eagle animation. 
    
**A**: By pressing this button the eagle scream is emitted. Every time the user click this button the scream is emitted.
